				<p>This section showcases two different tables created using HTML5. The first table presents a list of fruits, the vitamins they contain, and their respective colors, utilizing the 'colspan' property in one of its rows. The second table, on the other hand, is a list of favorite books, their authors, and the genre they belong to, effectively employing the 'rowspan' property. Both tables are complete with 'caption', 'thead', 'tbody', 'tfoot', 'th', 'td', and 'tr' elements, demonstrating their usage and importance in creating well-structured tables for the web.</p>
