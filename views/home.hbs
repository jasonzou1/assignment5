			<h1>Hello and welcome!</h1>
			<p>It's fantastic to see you here on my website, where we make web development feel less like rocket science and more like an exciting adventure. Don't worry if you're a beginner - that's exactly why we're here!

				We'll be exploring the basics of HTML5, which is the backbone of all websites you see on the internet, in a simple and easy-to-understand manner. Plus, we'll take a journey through the world of Express.js, a handy tool used for creating web applications. We'll learn all about "Routing," which is essentially the system that decides where your clicks on a website take you.
				
				Each tutorial and guide is designed to break down complex ideas into digestible bits, ensuring you'll never feel overwhelmed. And if you ever do, I'm just a message away to help clear up any confusion.
				
				Welcome to the starting line of your web development journey. Let's learn and grow together!</p>
